# gamedui

A do-it-yourself GameBoy built from easy to find 8x8 led matrix and whatever Arduino.

See gamedui.png for the schematics, brick.jpg and tetris.mov for a sample.

There are the Arduino projects and the twin windows projects.
I've developed all the games in win7, simulating the final environment. At the end of the development I've converted the win7 projects in Arduino projects with minor changes to the source code.

You can play your game in win7 and translate them in hardware only at the end.
